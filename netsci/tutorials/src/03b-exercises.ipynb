    "\n",
    "First of all, you may be confused between CDF (cumulative distribution function) and CCDF (complementary cumulative distribution function). They are all \"cumulative\", but the difference is that the former starts from left and the latter starts from the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, as [Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0412004v3.pdf) (Fig. 3 (d)) paper explains, plotting the CCDF (complementary cumulative distribution function) is probably the best method to show a heavy-tailed distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build the CCDF you start with the unbinned data `x` and `y`. Recall that `y` are the sorted counts associated with each value in `x`. To get the CCDF's value at a particular `x` you want to accumulate all the counts including and following that value. So the first value would just be the sum of all the counts, while the second value would be the sum of all the counts excluding the first one, and so on. In order to represent these values as probabilities, we need to normalize them by dividing all their elements by the largest value (which will always be the first value). This makes sure that the CCDF starts at 1.0 on the log-log plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, calculate the CCDF and plot it in a similar style (log-log, with symbols). As data, you can use the degree distribution, or the distribution of one of the centrality measures we have seen in class."
