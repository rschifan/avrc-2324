    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a library for producing publication-quality figures. mpl (for short) was designed from the beginning to serve two purposes. First, allow for interactive, cross-platform control of figures and plots, and second, to make it very easy to produce static raster or vector graphics files without the need for any GUIs. Furthermore, mpl -- much like Python itself -- gives the developer complete control over the appearance of their plots, while still being very usable through a powerful defaults system."

    "## Online Documentation\n",
    "The [matplotlib.org](http://matplotlib.org) project website is the primary online resource for the library's documentation. It contains [examples](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index), [FAQs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/faq.html), [API documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html), and, most importantly, the [gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gallery\n",
    "Many users of Matplotlib are often faced with the question, \"I want to make a figure that has X with Y in the same figure, but it needs to look like Z\". Good luck getting an answer from a web search with that query! This is why the [gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html) is so useful, because it showcases the variety of ways one can make figures. Browse through the gallery, click on any figure that has pieces of what you want to see and the code that generated it. Soon enough, you will be like a chef, mixing and matching components to produce your masterpiece!\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, if you have a new and interesting plot that demonstrates a feature of Matplotlib, feel free to submit a concise, well-commented version of the code for inclusion in the gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mailing Lists and StackOverflow\n",
    "When you are just simply stuck, and cannot figure out how to get something to work, or just need some hints on how to get started, you will find much of the community at the matplotlib-users [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users). This mailing list is an excellent resource of information with many friendly members who just love to help out newcomers. The number one rule to remember with this list is to be persistant. While many questions do get answered fairly quickly, some do fall through the cracks, or the one person who knows the answer isn't available. Therefore, try again with your questions rephrased, or with a plot showing your attempts so far. We love plots, so an image showing what is wrong often gets the quickest responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another community resource is [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib), so if you need to build up karma points, submit your questions here, and help others out too! We are also on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib).\n",

    "### Location\n",
    "[Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib) is hosted by GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bug Reports and feature requests\n",
    "So, you think you found a bug? Or maybe you think some feature is just too difficult to use? Or missing altogether? Submit your bug reports [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues) at Matplotlib's issue tracker. We even have a process for submitting and discussing Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals ([MEPs](http://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/MEP/index.html))."

    "General Concepts\n",
    "================\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib` has an extensive codebase that can be daunting to many\n",
    "new users. However, most of matplotlib can be understood with a fairly\n",
    "simple conceptual framework and knowledge of a few important points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting requires action on a range of levels, from the most general\n",
    "(e.g., 'contour this 2-D array') to the most specific (e.g., 'color\n",
    "this screen pixel red'). The purpose of a plotting package is to assist\n",
    "you in visualizing your data as easily as possible, with all the necessary\n",
    "control -- that is, by using relatively high-level commands most of\n",
    "the time, and still have the ability to use the low-level commands when\n",
    "needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, everything in matplotlib is organized in a hierarchy. At the top\n",
    "of the hierarchy is the matplotlib \"state-machine environment\" which is\n",
    "provided by the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. At this level, simple\n",
    "functions are used to add plot elements (lines, images, text, etc.) to\n",
    "the current axes in the current figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Pyplot's state-machine environment behaves similarly to MATLAB and\n",
    "   should be most familiar to users with MATLAB experience.</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level down in the hierarchy is the first level of the object-oriented\n",
    "interface, in which pyplot is used only for a few functions such as figure\n",
    "creation, and the user explicitly creates and keeps track of the figure\n",
    "and axes objects. At this level, the user uses pyplot to create figures,\n",
    "and through those figures, one or more axes objects can be created. These\n",
    "axes objects are then used for most plotting actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For even more control -- which is essential for things like embedding\n",
    "matplotlib plots in GUI applications -- the pyplot level may be dropped\n",

    "What is a backend?\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of documentation on the website and in the mailing lists refers\n",
    "to the \"backend\" and many new users are confused by this term.\n",
    "matplotlib targets many different use cases and output formats.  Some\n",
    "people use matplotlib interactively from the python shell and have\n",
    "plotting windows pop up when they type commands.  Some people embed\n",
    "matplotlib into graphical user interfaces like wxpython or pygtk to\n",
    "build rich applications.  Others use matplotlib in batch scripts to\n",
    "generate postscript images from some numerical simulations, and still\n",
    "others in web application servers to dynamically serve up graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support all of these use cases, matplotlib can target different\n",
    "outputs, and each of these capabilities is called a `backend`; the\n",
    "\"frontend\" is the user facing code, i.e., the plotting code, whereas the\n",
    "\"backend\" does all the hard work behind-the-scenes to make the figure.\n",
    "There are two types of backends: \n",
    "* user interface backends (for use in pygtk, wxpython, tkinter, qt4, or macosx; also referred to as \"interactive backends\")\n",
    "* hardcopy backends to make image files (PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as \"non-interactive backends\").\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four ways to configure your backend. If they conflict each other,\n",
    "the method mentioned last in the following list will be used, e.g. calling\n",
    "`matplotlib.use()` will override the setting in your ``matplotlibrc``.\n",
    "\n",

    "* The ``backend`` parameter in your ``matplotlibrc`` file:\n",

    "* Setting the `MPLBACKEND` environment\n",
    "   variable, either for your current shell or for a single script:\n",
    "\n",
    "        > export MPLBACKEND=\"module://my_backend\"\n",
    "        > python simple_plot.py\n",
    "\n",
    "        > MPLBACKEND=\"module://my_backend\" python simple_plot.py\n",
    "\n",

    "   in *any* ``matplotlibrc``, even if there is a ``matplotlibrc`` in your\n",
    "   current working directory. Therefore setting `MPLBACKEND`\n",
    "   globally, e.g. in your ``.bashrc`` or ``.profile``, is discouraged as it\n",
    "   might lead to counter-intuitive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If your script depends on a specific backend you can use the\n",
    "   `matplotlib.use` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "      import matplotlib\n",

    "   pyplot has been imported will have no effect.  Using\n",
    "   `matplotlib.use` will require changes in your code if users want to\n",
